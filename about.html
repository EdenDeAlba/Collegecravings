<h1 align="center">About the creator</h1>
<h3 class="spec2" align="center"><img src="eden.jpg" alt="Eden De Alba" width="418.4" height="418.2"><br><br><b>Eden De Alba</b><br>I always loved cooking. Living in a POC household, I was taught to not be afraid to try new things so I was exposed to many types of food and cultures. When I became a high school senior, I began looking for recipes I could use in the dorm rooms. However, I could never find a website that was made specifically for college students. Instead, I found a few general websites that only had a few recipes to tackle that problem. The few recipes that were there, I knew would not be affordable for a kid. So, I decided to do it myself</h3>

<h1 align="center">Our priorities</h1>

<h3 class="spec2">As mentioned on the homepage, our goal is to provide healthy, affordable, and delicious recipes to anyone who may need them, but especially those in colleges and universities. With this website, we will also offer videos to give visual learners a little more help.</h3>
